Algorithm: currentstate(theChosenOne, playerGuess, i)
Input: playerGuess is the ArrayList, theChosenOne is the string and i is positive integer
    Set i = 0
    FOR i< theChosenOne.length() DO
        IF playerGuess.contains(theChosenOne.charAt(i)) THEN
                Print(theChosenOne.charAt(i))
        ELSE IF i == 0 THEN
                Print(theChosenOne.charAt(0))
        ELSE IF i ==(theChosenOne.length()-1) THEN
                Print(theChosenOne.charAt(i))
        ELSE THEN
                Print(" - ")
        END IF
Output: the secret word with only the first character and last character, every other index is " - " and when the user guesses the right then the " - " will be replaceed by the right letter guessed.
