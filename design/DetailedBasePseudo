Algorithm: DetailedBase (wordsList, words, w, scan, choosing, theChosenOne)
Input: wordsList is the file object, words is an ArrayList, w is a Random object, scan is a Scanner object, choosing is positive integer, theChosenOne is a String,
WHILE scan.hasNextLine()
    words.add(scan.hasNextLine())
END WHILE
SET choosing = w.nexyInt(words.size())
SET theChosenOne = words.get(choosing)
OUTPUT: Getting the words from the file and saving those words to an ArrayList "words". Also, choosing a random word from the ArrayList.
